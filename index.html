            Have an injury, discomfort or pain that is preventing you from
            engaging in activities that you find enjoyable (e.g. walking,
            running, sports, gardening)? We are here to get you back to just
            that! With a thorough assessment, we determine the root cause of
            your concern and its contributing factors in order to develop a
            comprehensive treatment plan that will help to prevent and manage
            future injury.

          <p>
            Concussions are quite common in contact sports but often go
            unrecognized and untreated. Here at Kumi Physio we take a
            patient-centered approach where we provide education and
            recommendations to the patient and their family about managing
            concussions. This includes rehabilitation exercises, energy
            management strategies, psychosocial considerations, and gradual
            Return to School/Work/Play.

            Are you an individual who strives to maximize your sport
            performance? At Kumi Physio we look at how you move and consider the
            demands and needs of your sport(s) in order to provide
            sport-specific physiotherapy and training. Sport-specific
            strengthening and power exercises, mobility and agility drills, and
            cross-training will be incorporated to optimize performance.

            <h4>Registered Physiotherapist</h4>

          <div class="frank-text">
            <p>
              Frank Kumi grew up in Toronto playing competitive soccer and
              basketball. Frank was drawn into the rehabilitation community
              after going through several injuries himself. After completing his
              Bachelor of Science Degree in Kinesiology from York University,
              Frank obtained a Master of Science Degree in Physical Therapy from
              Queen’s University. Frank has furthered his clinical education by
              completing courses on Post-Concussion Management, Level 1 Manual
              Therapy, Soft Tissue Release, Acupuncture, and Pain Neuroscience
              education.
            </p>
            <p>
              Frank encourages an active approach to treatment by providing his
              clients with the education and exercises necessary to take control
              of their injury, as well as supplementing it with manual therapy
              as needed. As a lover of sports, you can find Frank playing
              basketball, soccer, volleyball, or working out when not at the
              clinic. Frank looks forward to building a strong therapeutic
              alliance with his clients and empowering them to achieve their
              goals!

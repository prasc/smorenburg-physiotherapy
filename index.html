            <p>
              Matt began his academic journey at Carleton University, graduating
              in 2015 with a Bachelor of Science degree in Neuroscience and
              Mental Health. He then completed his Master of Science degree
              within the field of Neuroscience at Queen’s University in 2017,
              exploring how eye movements can be used as a potential biomarker
              to diagnose and assess neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer’s
              disease. He was awarded the prestigious Frederick Banting and
              Charles Best Canada Graduate Scholarship for his research and
              accomplishments.
            </p>
            <p>
              After completing his thesis, Matt pursued a second Master of
              Science degree in Physical Therapy at Queen’s University,
              graduating in 2019. Matt has furthered his clinical training by
              completing courses in soft tissue release, advanced manual
              therapy, dry needling/acupuncture, pain neuroscience, and
              vestibular rehabilitation techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
              Matt has a special interest in treating a wide variety of clients,
              ranging from elite athletes to clients suffering from debilitating
              chronic pain. He also has experience treating clients suffering
              from vertigo, cervicogenic headaches, running injuries, and lower
              back pain, both acute and chronic.
            </p>
            <p>
              Matt is passionate about accelerating his clients’ recovery from
              injury. He values compassion, always striving to understand his
              client’s values and individualizes their rehabilitation to suit
              their functional needs and goals. He strives to implement
              evidence-informed techniques into his practice, remaining up to
              date on effective treatment strategies and educational approaches.
              When not at work, Matt loves to be outdoors camping, fishing,
              golfing and lifting weights.

        <p>Injury Rehabilitation and Prevention</p>
        <div>
          <img src="assets/svg/icons8-strength-96.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            As adaptive as the human body is, it is nearly impossible to go
            through our busy lives without sustaining an injury. Unfortunately,
            both acute and chronic pain can prevent you from participating in
            activities that are meaningful to you (i.e., walking, sports, work).
            I am here to work with you as a team to empower you and achieve your
            goals, whether they be to excel as an athlete or to hold your
            grandchildren without pain. I will assess the musculoskeletal and
            neurological systems during my assessment, and together, we will
            create an individualized treatment plan that works best for you to
            help you manage and prevent injury recurrence.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>Surgical Recovery</p>
        <div>
          <img src="assets/svg/icons8-brain-96.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            If you have recently had a surgery (i.e., rotator cuff, hip or knee
            replacement, etc.) or are preparing to have one, I will work with
            you to create a safe, effective, and evidence-based rehabilitation
            program. Together we will work on range of motion and strengthening
            exercises to accelerate your recovery.

        <p>Dizziness and Vertigo Treatment</p>
        <div>
          <img src="assets/svg/icons8-exercise-96.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            When it feels like the world is spinning, it can be quite
            challenging to complete even the simplest daily tasks. I will
            conduct a thorough neurological and vestibular assessment to find
            the source of your dizziness, and create an effective treatment
            program that works for you.

        <p>Chronic Headache Management</p>
        <div>
          <img src="assets/svg/image21.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            Do you suffer from chronic tension headaches or migraines? The
            source of most headaches can occur from the muscles, joints and/or
            nerves within the neck, jaw and shoulder(s). I will do a thorough
            examination to evaluate the cause of your headaches and will develop
            an effective exercise routine to reduce the frequency and alleviate
            your headaches.
